int CameraWidth = 150;    // 150 is the width of the Camera View
This variable detects the CameraWidth, and that will detect the amount of pixels that are infront of the robot.
The pixels that we are interested in are the 255 pixels.
For this to happen, we would use "if(brightness==255{                          // Detects pixels with a brightness of 255
